# Description

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is a blog website designed to inspire women to pursue careers in STEM fields. It is part of the University of Derby's "Team Project" course. Women starting at age 18 are the intended audience for this website.  Team members Nasteho Abdi, Tayyeba Sadaq, Rezuan Mohammed, Mehnaz Rahman, and Sri Pradeeptaa Anantha were responsible for creating the project. 


# Key Features 

Women in STEM is a blog website where users can navigate to the blog page by scrolling down to view the recommended topics. As you can see, the blogs page covers a wide range of subjects that might assist readers in learning about resources, career opportunities in STEM, and stress management. 

# How to use the BLOG? 

You can use the navigation bar to click onto the different pages such as, home, about us, contact and blog pages. Or you can use the homepage to look through the recommended posts. 


# Future

We want to make this website public to all women but before that, we want to make a phone application to have it more accessible to our primary audience given that mobiles are the most used devices.
