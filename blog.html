            <p>My Name is Sri Pradeeptaa Anantha, I am a 2nd Year Computer Science Undergraduate studying at the University of Derby and here is how a general day during the week looks for me.
                <br><br>
                The schedule for my lectures and tutorials vary everyday during the week and I like to plan my day in order for me to complete relevant tasks
                based of my timetable. Some days in the week, I have an early start to my day such as on a regular tuesday by waking up at 5:30am for me to head to university for training in the morning. I like to ensure I have made my bed and have eaten well for me to have a good effective start to the day.
                <br><br>
                Within and outside of the university I professionally play Badminton at county, national and international level. It is very important for me to have the balance between badminton and university work as I have been playing badminton ever since I was 8 years old and have a dream to compete in the olympics as well as at suceeding at university, both essentially being my primary goals. 
                <br><br> 
                My training sessions are a block of two hours and I play from 7-8:30am. After training, I like to shower and get ready to attend my lectures for the day. 
                I head to my main campus, where all my lectures and tutorials are timetabled. 
                I attend lectures along with my friends from 9:00am to 12:00pm in the morning. Leading into the afternoon after my lectures have finished I work as a Computational Maths Lab Support Ambassador for first year students helping them with any questions they ask me regarding the module. 
                <br><br>
                I finish work at about 1:00pm and get home for 1:30pm to have lunch and prepare myself for the rest of the day. After, I like to make notes from the lectures I attended as well as completing lab work or revision to help me with assingments set. I have been priortising applying to placements as next year is an important year for me and I believe it will help me gain experience for when I start working after I graduate. 
                <br><br>  
                Finally, I head back to university at 5:00pm to go to the gym for two hours and finish at 7:00pm. My day finishes off by making a list of things I want to complete for the next day that I was unable to finish and also ensure I have packed my bag for BUCS games, which are usually scheduled every wednesday. 
                <br><br>
                After 8:00pm I like to wind down and do some gaming, listen to music or watch a show. This is also when I like to catch up with family as I live in student accomodation away from home and tend to miss my family a lot. 
                <br><br>
                Around 11:00pm, I end the day by getting the most important thing to help me function throughout the day which is sleep. This helps me make sure I can effectively work the next day with sufficeint sleep rather than making me feel tired. I always try to fit in three meals a day and 8 hours of sleep, but sometimes due to my schedule varying and making my day more busy I struggle to always accomplish both but still try and work around it.</p>

            <p>Hi there, I'm Nasteho Abdi, and I'm a second-year undergraduate computer science student.  My commute takes about an hour each way, so I lead a very long but structured day. Thus, it depends on the day I attend lectures and tutorials. For instance, on Mondays, I would wake up around 6:00 and get ready for the day by taking a shower, brushing my teeth, and applying skincare products. I would then quickly have breakfast to get me through the day. I would take a taxi at 7:30 and arrive there in either 45 minutes or an hour. If I have arrived early then I would buy a drink and some food for myself and then I chatted with my close friends.  When the lecture time comes, I try to complete the assigned work and take notes.
                <br><br>
                If there is a break in the afternoon before the last lesson, we would go grab something to eat and then concentrate on assignments or go over the things covered in class in the library or another quiet area. After finishing that, I would unwind by reading a book or watching comfort show. 
                <br><br>
                Returning home would take an hour once the tutorials were over. I spend time with my family and talk to my mother once I'm at home. After taking a shower upstairs, I would get ready for study sessions, which included going over my notes from class and getting ready for the following day's lesson. I would end study sessions at around eight o'clock.
                <br><br>
                Before 9:30 p.m., I start to unwind and read books or watch comfort television. I then try to get a good night's sleep so that I may wake up feeling rested and ready for the next day.

            <p>Hiya! My name is Tayyeba Sadaq and I'm a 2nd year computer science undergrad at Derby University. I live at home while attending university which makes my life a lot easier to manage and organise since I have my family here with me. An average day for me consists of an early start around 6:30 where I'll get up and ready for the day, eating a breakfast prepped the day before with my family. From there it depends on when my lectures start but I'll usually make a trip to university with one of my parents giving me a lift.
                <br><br>
                I meet up with my friends on site and we attend any lectures and tutorials for the day. Most of these sessions are spread in the morning at the moment and finish around lunchtime. In lectures I'm typically making notes and during tutorials I usually sit with my friends and work through the tasks with one desktop and many minds, often in a doc that we share later. Post lessons and lectures I usually hang around a little extra at uni, this involves doing some extra work for modules, chatting with my friends and sometimes getting a bite to eat (whatever we're in the mood for at the time.)
                <br><br>
                After that, it's a quick trip home, a house clean-up, given that I have brothers, and then a small break before I login to my PC to organise anything I've done and make some sort of flexible plan for the rest of my day. At the moment, I've been working hard on trying to develop a portfolio of projects and get more confident in programming. So writing some code always falls into my plans.
                <br><br>
                At around 6:00PM is when I'll have my dinner with my family for a day catchup and then around 8:00PM i'm back on my PC to unwind slowly from work, usually through playing a game. Every day is slightly different, some are more work focussed and others laid back but I try hard to make sure there's some semblance of balance between work and relaxation...Just so that I don't completely lose my mind, but make sure I'm not slacking off üòâ</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Rezuan Mohammed, an undergraduate second-year Computer Science student - studying at the University of Derby. A typical day in my life consists of eating a balanced breakfast upon waking up, and also making sure my cat enjoys a healthy breakfast with me! 
                <br><br>
                I will then begin to get ready for the day by applying skincare and getting dressed. Shortly after this, I will make my way to the University via car - I live in the city so it‚Äôs a short 15-minute drive, during which I'll listen to music to keep me in a calm state of mind. Once I arrive at University, I will briefly catch up with friends and we will then make our way to any timetabled lectures or lab sessions together. During our breaks, we will grab some food to fuel us for the rest of the day and exchange some funny conversations. 
                <br><br>
                Once I finish my sessions for the day at University, I will head home and eat another balanced and protein-filled meal to energise me for the gym which I will attend not long after. Post gym, I will have another snack to rejuvenate my body once again and I will enjoy this while watching an anime. I do this to allow myself to unwind after having a long day at university.  Once I have relaxed, I will go over my lectures to reaffirm my mind on the content that was taught that day to ensure that I do not fall behind. Additionally, I will complete any work that was set in the tutorials/lab sessions that day. 
                <br><br>
                Towards the end of the evening, I will begin my night-time routine which consists of eating some fruit, doing skincare, brushing my teeth, and showering followed by spending some time with my cat before going to bed.</p>

            <p>Hi! My name is Mehnaz and I'm a second year computer science student. A typical day starts with dragging myself to morning lectures or labs and catching up with my friends at uni where we get a lot of work (talking) done. Then, I come back to my accommodation and prioritise going over the lecture slides for each week to make sure my understanding of the work is solidified. I make sure to do at least one week of lectures every day - this ends up taking around just over 3 hours, with 5 minute breaks in between each module.
                <br><br>
                After that, I let myself unwind, by either meeting up with friends to get food or FaceTiming them and playing games together. By evening time, the kitchen will have gotten kind of messy, so me and another flatmate get to cleaning it up, talking and ranting about anything and everything. Finally, I end my day by showering and going to bed. Overall, I make sure to have a balance of revision and relaxing to try and minimise stress while also staying on top of uni work.</p>
